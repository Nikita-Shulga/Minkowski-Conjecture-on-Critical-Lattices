# Minkowski-Conjecture-on-Critical-Lattices
This project is about computer-assisted proof of the Minkowski conjecture on critical lattices.

The following two links should contain the interactive plot of the function $\Delta(p,\sigma)$ as a function of $\sigma$. The value of $p$ is fixed and can be changed using a slider.

The following picture is a collection of curves $\Delta(p,\sigma)$ for sampled values of $p\in (1,20]$ as functions of $\sigma$.
